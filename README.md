# English-to-Hinglish-tanslation

# Project Aim
Project Aim:
Develop a translation model capable of generating Hinglish text that closely resembles spoken Hindi language patterns.
Retain certain English words to improve clarity, especially for non-native Hindi speakers.
Ensure that the Hinglish translations accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentences.

# How to run the code
The translation model we have developed serves as the primary component, utilizing NLTK for text processing and leveraging the Google Translate API to convert English sentences into Hinglish. As part of this model, we have included a function that effectively identifies and extracts nouns from input sentences using NLTK. Additionally, another function utilizes the Google Translate API to accurately translate English sentences into Hindi. Notably, we have also implemented a logic for replacing nouns in the Hindi translation with their appropriate English counterparts, while still retaining certain English words to enhance clarity.
